Bare metal Bluetooth object-oriented stack development (initially targetted for Raspberry Pii/ARM processor).
Initially, Bluetooth HCI/Baseband and L2CAPP protocol support and Bluetooth Classic protocol support for SDP, HIDP, RFCOMM is going to be provided.
Later, Bluetooth Low Energy support is to be provided in future versions.
The work is intended to support baremetal Bluetooth development without any OS framework.
